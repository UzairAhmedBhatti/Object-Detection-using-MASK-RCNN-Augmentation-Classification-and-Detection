# Object-Detection-using-MASK-RCNN-Augmentation-Classification-and-Detection
This project involved classification of two types of identity cards using a binary classifier followed by detection of credentials mentioned on the cards, through transfer learning.

The project was divided into two phases:
Phase 1 included the annotation and augmentation of images to be used for training the models.
Phase 2 included training the models, then classifying cards and detecting labels on the cards.
